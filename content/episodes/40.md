Orca is a WebAssembly runtime, but that alone won't give you an idea of what the project is about. There are plenty of WASM runtimes out there and some just that (a way of running WASM) and some are a bit more, like [WASM-4](https://wasm4.org/) for example, which is a fantasy console.

On the [official Orca website](https://orca-app.dev/) we can find this description:

>Today, the web has become the de facto platform for safely distributing applications on a wide range of devices. Unfortunately, this comes at a huge complexity cost, as the base layers of the web were never designed for that purpose.

If you too find the web a bit bloated and are curious about how Orca aims to tackle this problem, join Martin and me for a new Zig SHOWTIME episode.
